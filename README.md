# CUDA Tutorial

This repository contains a hands-on tutorial for programming CUDA.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the tutorial up and running on your CUDA-capable machine. 

### Prerequisites

> For JCSSE 2018 workshop attendees, you can skip this step. 

We expect you to have access to CUDA-enabled GPUs (see. [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)) and have sufficient C/C++ programming knowledge. 

Following softwares are required for compiling the tutorials 
  * [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 
  * gcc (See. [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html) for more supported compilers )
